Also, there is a lack of fit between the verb form have attracted and the preposition after.  A The phrase cute and cuddly is adjectival, as is biologically different ...; adding the word being is not useful and impairs parallelism. The verb form have attracted suggests a process continuing from some point in the past, but the word efter is most naturally read as indicating the time of a single event relative to an earlier point in time.  B The word being is superfluous here.The word since indicates continuation over a past period, whereas the verb attracted indicates a single event occurring within a period.  C The word being is superfluous here and impairs parallelism.The verb attracted, indicating a single event, does not match the use of the word since,which indicates a continuing duration relative to the time of an earlier event.  D The verb have attracted, indicating continuation, does not match the use of the word after, which is appropriate in order to give the time of a single event relative to an earlier point in time.
