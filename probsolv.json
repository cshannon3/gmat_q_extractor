Any point equidistant from the points (0,0) and (0,6) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment with endpoints (0,0) and (0,6), which is the line with equation y = 3. Therefore, the point that is equidistant from (0,0), (4,0), and (0,6) must lie on both of the lines x = 2 and y = 3, which is the point (2,3).  Alternatively, let (x,y) be the point equidistant from (0,0), (4,0), and (0,6).

        "explanation_text": " Since there is only one correct answer, one method of solving the problem is to choose values for m and v and determine which of the expressions gives the correct number for these values. For example, if m = 6 and v = 1, then there are 2 even integers less than 6 and greater than 1, namely the even integers 2 and 4. As the table below shows, m - v - 1 is the only expression  2 given that equals 2. m - v \ufffd 1 = 1.5 2  m - v -1 =2 2  m - v = 2.5 2  m \ufffd v \ufffd 1=4 m \ufffd v=5  To solve this problem it is not necessary to show that m - v - 1 always gives the correct number  2 of even integers. However, one way this can be done is by the following method, first shown for a specific example and then shown in general. For the specific example, suppose v = 15 and m = 144. Then a list--call it the first list--of the even integers greater than v and less than m is 16, 18, 20, ..., 140, 142. Now subtract 14 (chosen so that the second list will begin with 2) from each of the integers in the first list to form a second list, which has the same number of integers as the first list: 2, 4, 6, ..., 128. Finally, divide each of the first list: 2, 4, 6, ..., 128. Finally, divide each of the integers in the second list (all of which are even)  by 2 to form a third list, which also has the same number of integers as the first list: 1, 2, 3, ..., 64.  Since the number of integers in the third list is 64, it follows that the number of integers in the  first list is 64. For the general situation, the first list is the following list of even integers: v + 1, v + 3, v + 5, ..., m \ufffd 4, m \ufffd 2. Now subtract the even integer v \ufffd 1 from (i.e., add \ufffdv + 1 to) each of the integers in the first list to obtain the second list: 2, 4, 6, ..., m \ufffd v \ufffd 3, m \ufffd v \ufffd 1. (Note, for example, that m \ufffd 4 \ufffd (v \ufffd 1) = m \ufffd v \ufffd 3.) Finally, divide each of the integers (all of which are even) in the second list by 2 to obtain the  third list: 1, 2, 3, ..., m - v - 3, m - v - 1. 2  2  Since the number of integers in the third list is  m - v - 1, it follows that the number of integers 2  in the first list is m - v - 1 . 2  The correct answer is B.

Therefore, the digits of (25 \ufffd 10n) + (k \ufffd 102n) consist of the digits of k followed by the digits 2 and 5, followed by two digits of 0.

Since OC = AC, OCA is isosceles and so the base angles, AOC and OAC, have the same degree measure. The measure of AOC is given as x\ufffd, so the measure of OAC is x\ufffd. Since AC = AB, CAB is isosceles and so the base angles, ACB and ABC, have the same degree measure. The measure of each is marked as y\ufffd.
